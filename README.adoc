= Trinities

== Problem Statement

Given `n` finite, disjoint sets with cardinalities ``c = [c_1, ..., c_n]``, form the largest possible set `T` of triplets by selecting elements from the sets without replacement.
A triplet may not contain multiple elements from the same set.
What's the cardinality of `T`?


== Terminology

Phase:: A sequence of operations in which a given triplet is repeatedly removed from the corresponding three sets.


== Naive Attempt

The `naivePhases` is an obvious, but suboptimal, attempt at a solution.
The idea is to:

. identify the biggest three sets `X`, `Y` & `Z` (the choice doesn't matter if there are multiple options);
. remove `min(|X|, |Y|, |Z|)` triplets from these sets;
. repeat until there are no triplets left.

This algorithm underestimates some cases though, e.g. if sets `A`, `B`, `C` and `D` have cardinalities 26, 26, 31 and 4, then `naivePhases` only manages to remove 26 triplets, i.e.

[source,haskell]
----
countTriplets (naivePhases $ mkProblem [26,26,31,4]) == 26
----

But you can form 28 triplets as follows:

[options="header"]
|===
| Phase No. | `\|A\|` | `\|B\|` | `\|C\|` | `\|D\|` | `\|T\|`
| 0 |  26 |  26 |  31 |   4 |   0
| 1 |   2 |   2 |   7 |   4 |  24
| 2 |   0 |   2 |   5 |   2 |  26
| 3 |   0 |   0 |   3 |   0 |  28
|===


== Better Attempt

We can achieve better results by only removing one triplet from the biggest three sets.
The `betterPhases` function does this, and it removes 28 triplets in the `[26,26,31,4]` case.


== Functionality

The `main` function loads the example problems from link:data/TrinitySnapshotTest-12_20-12_22.csv[data/TrinitySnapshotTest-12_20-12_22.csv], evaluates them using `naivePhases` and `betterPhases`, and prints out CSV tables that show failures and improvements.
Failures are cases where the `*Phases` function performs worse than the lower bound specified in the file, and improvements are cases where it performs better.


== Results

* `naivePhases` matches the triplet counts in the example problems.
* `betterPhases` produces no failures and several improvements, shown in link:data/Improvements.csv[data/Improvements.csv].
  ** In this file, each phase is specified with the notation `n Ã— (i,j,k)`, meaning: remove `n` triplets from sets `i`, `j` and `k`.
