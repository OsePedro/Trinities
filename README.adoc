= Trinities

== Problem Statement

Given `n` finite, disjoint sets with cardinalities ``c = [c_1, ..., c_n]``, form the largest possible set `T` of triplets by selecting elements from the sets without replacement.
A triplet may not contain multiple elements from the same set.
What's the cardinality of `T`?


== Naive Attempt

****
Phase:: A sequence of consecutive removals of triplets from three sets.
****

The `naivePhases` is an obvious, but suboptimal, attempt at a solution.
The idea is to:

. identify the biggest three sets `X`, `Y` & `Z` (the choice doesn't matter if there are multiple options);
. remove `min(|X|, |Y|, |Z|)` triplets from these sets;
. repeat until there are no triplets left.

This algorithm underestimates some cases though, e.g. if sets `A`, `B`, `C` and `D` have cardinalities 26, 26, 31 and 4, then `naivePhases` only manages to remove 26 triplets, i.e.

[source,haskell]
----
countTriplets (naivePhases $ mkProblem [26,26,31,4]) == 26
----

But you can form 28 triplets as follows:

[options="header"]
|===
| Phase No. | `\|A\|` | `\|B\|` | `\|C\|` | `\|D\|` | `\|T\|`
| 0 |  26 |  26 |  31 |   4 |   0
| 1 |   2 |   2 |   7 |   4 |  24
| 2 |   0 |   2 |   5 |   2 |  26
| 3 |   0 |   0 |   3 |   0 |  28
|===


== Better Attempt

We can achieve better results by only removing one triplet from the biggest three sets.
The `betterPhases` function does this, and it removes 28 triplets in the `[26,26,31,4]` case.


== Functionality

The `main` function does the following:

. Tests `betterPhases` on randomly generated problems, and prints all identified failures and improvements.
. Loads the example problems from link:data/TrinitySnapshotTest-12_20-12_22.csv[data/TrinitySnapshotTest-12_20-12_22.csv], evaluates them using `naivePhases` and `betterPhases`, and prints all identified failures and improvements.

****
Failure:: a case where a `*Phases` function performs worse than a known lower bound (e.g. a lower bound specified in the file).
Improvement:: a case where it performs better.
****

Failures and improvements are printed as a CSV table, in which each phase is specified with the notation `n Ã— (i,j,k)`, meaning: remove `n` triplets from sets `i`, `j` and `k`.
If a `*Phases` function produces no failures on a given set of problems, nothing is printed.
The same goes for improvements.


== Results

* `naivePhases`:
  .. Matches the example-problem triplet counts.
  .. Fails hundreds of the randomly generated problems (see <<Building & Running>>).
* `betterPhases`:
  .. Produces no failures and several improvements on the example problems, shown in link:data/Improvements.csv[data/Improvements.csv].
  .. Matches the triplet counts on the randomly generated problems.


== Building & Running

Build and run by executing the following in the root directory:

[source,shell]
----
cabal run
----

To call functions directly, load GHCi in the root directory with:

[source,shell]
----
cabal repl
----

To view the `naivePhases` failures on the randomly-generated problems, run
[source,haskell]
----
testPhases "naivePhases" naivePhases
----

in GHCi.
